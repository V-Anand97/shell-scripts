#A shell script is a computer program designed to be run by the Unix shell, 
#a command-line interpreter. The various dialects of shell scripts are considered to be scripting
# languages. A shell usually interprets a single line of input, but we can also create a file
# containing a number of lines of commands to be interpreted. This file is a program known as a
# shell script. The program can also contain control structures (if-then, loops). Shell scripts 
#allow a sequence of commands to be executed automatically .
