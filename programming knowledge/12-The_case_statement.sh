The case statement is used to execute statements based on specific values. 
Often used in place of an if statement, if there are a large number of conditions.
The variable is compared with the values using the shell wildcards ( ? * [â€¦] ) , 
NOT regular expressions.
All the statements are executed for the first matching value until the ending ;;. 
If no value matches, then the default *) case is executed, if present.
case statement:
Specify number of possible values for variable
Statement block executed for matching value
Only one block executed
